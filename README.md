# postInstallUbuntu

This script aims at reducing installing all the packages I like to have on an Ubuntu/Debian based distrib.

It has two modes : full install or on a single package basis.

The full install will install :
* pcmanfm
* git
* vim (and add some options to the vimrc)
* latest owncloud client
* latest awesome wm
* awesome copycats themes (and tailor the theme as I like it)
* nfs
* locate
